## Overview
This project aims to develop drivers for the UART protocol using bare-metal C code for transmitting and receiving data between an STM32 microcontroller and a personal computer.

## Hardware requirements
1. STM32F4 microcontroller (e.g., STM32F401RE Nucleo board)
2. USB-to-serial adapter (if not using a development board with built-in USB-to-UART functionality)
3. Personal computer

## Software Requirements
1. STM32Cube IDE
2. STM32CubeF4 package (For CMSIS)
3. Serial terminal application (e.g., PuTTY, RealTerm)
